## Overview of the analysis
   We build a table using data stored in a javaScript array. and created filters to make this table fully dynamic, placed the table into an HTML file for easy viewing, we customized the webpage using bootstrap. 
we added table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape.
## Results
we can perform a search in this webpage by filtering the date, city, state, country and shape as shown below:<br><br>
Filter by Date:

Filter by City:

and we can perform search for state, country and shape the same way just by entering the search values and pressing "Enter" and we can reset the table by clicking on "UFO Sightings" on upper left corner of the page.


## Summary
drawback: instead of pressing enter we could use a "Search" button, that way after applying all the filters we could click on that button.<br>
recommendations: we can use at least two buttons for filtering our table.<br>
1- "Clear" button to clear our filter, instead of using "UFO Sightings" link.<br>
2- "Search" button as i mentioned early to apply the filters.
